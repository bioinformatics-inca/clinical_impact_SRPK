# Role of SRPK in melanoma prognosis üß¨üîç

This repository contains scripts used to generate figures associated with the following study: "Impaired expression of serine/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) affects melanoma progression in mice". The data belong to the work of Jerby-Arnon et al (2018), and our aim was to analyze the role of SRPKs among the subcluster of malignant cells, more specifically a group of malignant cells with high expression of SRPK2 and its clinical impact on metastatic melanoma patients.

The output of these scripts can be viewed in html at this link [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12w7PMj8gweDkV3XpaIhxYMQMwBpX-T0F?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12w7PMj8gweDkV3XpaIhxYMQMwBpX-T0F?usp=sharing)

The bioinformatics analysis was performed by Gabriela Rapozo and Leandro Santos, supervised by Mariana Boroni, PI of the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Laboratory of the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA).
